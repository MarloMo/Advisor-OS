# Advisor OS

**An AI Chief of Staff for Financial Advisors**

Advisor OS is an early-stage financial-technology project exploring how artificial intelligence can help financial advisors monitor an entire book of business, identify important developments, and determine where their attention is needed most.

The objective is not to replace the financial advisor. It is to give the advisor a more intelligent operating system for preparing, prioritizing, documenting, and acting.

> Advisor OS is currently in research and development. This repository presents the public product vision; proprietary models, decision logic, and implementation details are intentionally not published here.

## The Problem

Financial advisors work across fragmented systems containing portfolio data, financial plans, client notes, service requests, market information, and compliance requirements. Important signals can be difficult to identify consistently across hundreds of client relationships.

Most advisor technology is reactive: it stores information and waits for the advisor to search for it. Advisor OS is designed around a proactive model—continuously evaluating relevant information and producing a prioritized view of what may require attention.

## Product Vision

Advisor OS is intended to function as an intelligence and workflow layer across the advisor's existing technology stack.

Each review cycle would generate a concise briefing containing:

- Clients who may require attention
- Portfolio risks and material changes
- Planning and tax-planning opportunities
- Upcoming meetings and recommended preparation
- Unresolved service or relationship tasks
- Compliance-sensitive events and documentation needs
- Suggested next actions ranked by impact, urgency, and confidence

Every finding should be explainable, supported by relevant data, and presented for professional review.

## Who It Is For

Advisor OS is being designed with the needs of the following users and organizations in mind:

- Financial advisors
- Registered investment advisers
- Broker-dealers
- Banks
- Wealth-management firms
- Fintech

## Proposed Capabilities

### Prioritized Advisor Briefing

Transform activity across an advisor's book into a focused daily action list instead of another collection of alerts.

### Portfolio Intelligence

Surface material changes in allocation, concentration, risk, income, and portfolio positioning for advisor review.

### Financial-Planning Intelligence

Identify potential planning gaps, upcoming milestones, and changes that may warrant a client conversation.

### Meeting Preparation and Follow-Up

Summarize relevant client history, organize discussion points, propose follow-up tasks, and support consistent documentation.

### Compliance-Aware Workflows

Attach supporting evidence, rationale, confidence, disclosures, and review history to generated findings.

### Multi-Domain Analysis

Connect portfolio, planning, tax, relationship, and compliance information so that advisors can evaluate a client situation in context.

## Design Principles

Advisor OS is guided by several core principles:

1. **Advisor in control** — The system supports professional judgment; it does not autonomously provide or implement financial advice.
2. **Evidence before assertion** — Material findings should be traceable to verified source data.
3. **Explainability by default** — Recommendations should include a rationale, supporting information, confidence level, and proposed next action.
4. **Deterministic financial logic** — Financial calculations and defined risk rules should rely on testable, deterministic methods.
5. **Compliance and auditability** — Important outputs and decisions should support review, documentation, and an auditable history.
6. **Security and least privilege** — Access to sensitive financial and client information should be tightly controlled.
7. **Human-centered prioritization** — The purpose of the system is to reduce noise and help advisors focus on the clients and issues where their judgment matters most.

## Initial Development Direction

The initial proof of concept is expected to focus on a narrow workflow:

1. Import structured sample data
2. Evaluate portfolios and relevant client events
3. Detect a limited set of explainable opportunities and risks
4. Rank findings by materiality and urgency
5. Present the results in an advisor-facing briefing
6. Generate meeting-preparation and documentation support

The project will expand only after the underlying analysis, controls, and advisor workflow have been validated.

## Project Status

Advisor OS is currently an independent, early-stage research and development project. The current priorities are:

- Defining the product requirements and system boundaries
- Building a controlled proof of concept with synthetic or non-sensitive data
- Validating high-value advisor workflows
- Developing an evidence and audit framework
- Measuring time saved, opportunities identified, and workflow quality

No production release is currently available.

## Public Repository Scope

This public repository may include product documentation, research notes, non-proprietary prototypes, interface concepts, and selected demonstrations.

It does not disclose confidential client information, employer systems or processes, proprietary signal definitions, scoring methods, client-state models, compliance logic, or production architecture.
